## 1. Introduction
### 1.1. The Problem
In many communities, a significant number of books remain unused or forgotten on personal shelves, while others struggle to access affordable or diverse reading materials. This imbalance limits the circulation of knowledge and restricts readers‚Äô opportunities to discover new authors or genres. Furthermore, the lack of accessible platforms that foster interaction among readers contributes to the underutilization of existing literary resources and reduces engagement within the reading community.

### 1.2. The Solution
Book‚Äôn Deal is a mobile application designed to facilitate the exchange and donation of books among users. The platform enables individuals to publish books they wish to share, explore available titles, and connect directly with other readers through an integrated chat system. By promoting book reuse and community interaction, the app encourages sustainable reading habits and the free exchange of knowledge.

## 3. Strategy
### 3.1. Value Proposition Canvas
The Value Proposition Canvas served as a key tool to align our understanding of users with the project‚Äôs objectives.
It helped visualize what users truly value ‚Äî not only functional benefits such as easily obtaining books, 
but also emotional aspects like belonging to a community and contributing to sustainability.
This process revealed that users are motivated by collaboration and shared learning, not just by economic savings.
As a result, the app‚Äôs value proposition focuses on connection, accessibility, and environmental impact, 
creating a meaningful experience that goes beyond a simple exchange platform.

### 3.2. UIX Persona
UX Personas allow us to understand the needs, goals, and frustrations of our users. By visualizing these profiles, 
we can make informed design decisions, prioritize key features, and create an experience that is intuitive, 
engaging, and truly user-centered.

### 3.3. Benchmarking
Analyzing platforms such as BookMooch, Librologia, PaperbackSwap, and ReLibrea helped us identify which features are most useful to users and which create confusion or difficulty. 
This allowed us to decide which functionalities to include, enhance, or remove in our application, creating a more intuitive and engaging experience tailored to the real 
needs of readers, students, and teachers looking to exchange or donate books.

## 4. Scope
### 4.1. Customer Journey Map
The customer journey map illustrates how users experience the platform at each stage, from discovering it for the first time to becoming engaged community members. 
By mapping customer actions, channels, pain points, opportunities, and emotions, it guides improvements and helps deliver a valuable and engaging journey, encouraging users to return and promote the app.

## 5. Structure
### 5.1. Navigation Flow
The navigation flow shows how users interact with the application and how different screens and interfaces are connected. 
It helps ensure the experience is clear, intuitive, and efficient, making it easier for users to find and use key features without confusion.
Here, the navigation flow illustrates how our app works, allowing users to register and log in, publish a book, chat with other users, and view their own profile.

## 6. Skeleton
### 6.1. Low-Fi Wireframes
The wireframes developed for this project provide an initial overview of the app structure and core visual organization for Book ‚Äòn deal main functionalities. Navigation across screens is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to move seamlessly between searching for books, managing their profile, publishing new book listings, and initiating chats with other users.

In early iterations, wireframes were grouped into five key interface categories:
Book search and available listings.
User profile management and ranking.
Book publication.
Chat/messaging system.
Registration and login flow.

A workspace containing the full set of low-fidelity wireframes is available, showcasing initial screen layouts and user journeys from onboarding to key interactions like book exchange, profile editing, and conversations. As the app concept progressed, multiple interface details such as book filters, recommendations, and ranking features were refined to better address user needs and streamline navigation for both new and returning users.

## 7. Surface
### 7.1. Interface Evolution
The interface evolution process for Book 'n Deal included significant refinements aimed at simplifying the user experience and enhancing engagement. Initially, a dedicated book exchange section was planned. However, this was ultimately discarded in favor of enabling users to negotiate exchanges directly through the chat functionality. This change was motivated by the belief that personal communication would allow users greater freedom and flexibility to decide whether and how to exchange their books.

Additionally, the ranking system was incorporated later in the design process to motivate user participation and reward active contributors. Throughout the progression from low-fidelity wireframes to high-fidelity prototypes, interface improvements were made to margins, spacing, and overall visual clarity to optimize usability.

Navigation and key features such as book search, profile management, book publication, and messaging were refined to foster an intuitive flow and smooth transitions. The evolution reflects a user-centered approach prioritizing simplicity, flexible communication, and community building, balancing functionality with ease of use to create a welcoming and effective platform for book sharing and interaction.
