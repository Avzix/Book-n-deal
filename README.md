## 1. Introduction
### 1.1. The Problem
In many communities, a significant number of books remain unused or forgotten on personal shelves, while others struggle to access affordable or diverse reading materials. This imbalance limits the circulation of knowledge and restricts readers’ opportunities to discover new authors or genres. Furthermore, the lack of accessible platforms that foster interaction among readers contributes to the underutilization of existing literary resources and reduces engagement within the reading community.

### 1.2. The Solution
Book’n Deal is a mobile application designed to facilitate the exchange and donation of books among users. The platform enables individuals to publish books they wish to share, explore available titles, and connect directly with other readers through an integrated chat system. By promoting book reuse and community interaction, the app encourages sustainable reading habits and the free exchange of knowledge.

This project presents a user-centered design proposal for a digital platform
that enables the exchange and donation of used books. The initiative aims to 
promote reading, equitable access to knowledge, and the reuse of resources
by connecting readers, students, and educational communities in a 
collaborative environment.
The development focuses on understanding real user needs, defining a clear
value proposition, and creating an intuitive and meaningful user experience
through high-fidelity prototypes.

## 3. Strategy
### 3.1. Value Proposition Canvas
The Value Proposition Canvas served as a key tool to align our understanding of users with the project’s objectives.
It helped visualize what users truly value — not only functional benefits such as easily obtaining books, 
but also emotional aspects like belonging to a community and contributing to sustainability.
This process revealed that users are motivated by collaboration and shared learning, not just by economic savings.
As a result, the app’s value proposition focuses on connection, accessibility, and environmental impact, 
creating a meaningful experience that goes beyond a simple exchange platform.

## 6. Skeleton
### 6.1. Low-Fi Wireframes
The wireframes developed for this project provide an initial overview of the app structure and core visual organization for Book ‘n deal main functionalities. Navigation across screens is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to move seamlessly between searching for books, managing their profile, publishing new book listings, and initiating chats with other users.

In early iterations, wireframes were grouped into five key interface categories:
Book search and available listings.
User profile management and ranking.
Book publication.
Chat/messaging system.
Registration and login flow.

A workspace containing the full set of low-fidelity wireframes is available, showcasing initial screen layouts and user journeys from onboarding to key interactions like book exchange, profile editing, and conversations. As the app concept progressed, multiple interface details such as book filters, recommendations, and ranking features were refined to better address user needs and streamline navigation for both new and returning users.

## 7. Surface
### 7.1. Interface Evolution
The interface evolution process for Book 'n Deal included significant refinements aimed at simplifying the user experience and enhancing engagement. Initially, a dedicated book exchange section was planned. However, this was ultimately discarded in favor of enabling users to negotiate exchanges directly through the chat functionality. This change was motivated by the belief that personal communication would allow users greater freedom and flexibility to decide whether and how to exchange their books.

Additionally, the ranking system was incorporated later in the design process to motivate user participation and reward active contributors. Throughout the progression from low-fidelity wireframes to high-fidelity prototypes, interface improvements were made to margins, spacing, and overall visual clarity to optimize usability.

Navigation and key features such as book search, profile management, book publication, and messaging were refined to foster an intuitive flow and smooth transitions. The evolution reflects a user-centered approach prioritizing simplicity, flexible communication, and community building, balancing functionality with ease of use to create a welcoming and effective platform for book sharing and interaction.

### 7.4. New changes
Due to multiple rounds of feedback on our high-fidelity interfaces, several changes were made and new elements were added to make the app’s flow smoother and less abrupt. 
New sections were introduced to better complement existing interfaces, reduce information overload, and distribute content more effectively across the application.

## Login / Register

|       Before        |       After             |  
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| ![inicio-registro(before)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bd0732a-6295-4c4e-82ce-679d1960416a) | ![inicio-registro(after)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a465dfd-2b5d-462e-b718-6e33c81c0758) |

To address the lack of clear error feedback in the login and registration interfaces, several improvements were implemented. Informative placeholders were added to guide users on the expected input format, reducing confusion and helping prevent incorrect submissions.

In the registration form, password security requirements were made explicit, including a clearly stated minimum of 6 characters. This ensures users understand the criteria before attempting to create an account, reducing frustration and failed attempts.

As a result of these enhancements, users now receive clearer guidance throughout the process, improving overall usability, reducing registration errors, and supporting a smoother, more intuitive experience 
that aligns with heuristic best practices for error prevention and communication.


## Feed

|       Before        |       After             |  
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| ![feed(before)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7037c860-1d43-478e-b519-4d2a74209479) |   ![feed(after)_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0bc29ba-1a88-4d5c-8707-cb12ea72545a) ![feedbef2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69142a54-214d-4a21-bfe0-03cff431dff2) |

To address the lack of visual hierarchy and structural clarity in the main feed interface—where users browse published books and view publication details—several refinements were introduced.
The comments section was removed to create a cleaner and more focused layout. This reduction of unnecessary visual noise helps users concentrate on the essential elements of each publication, improving readability and overall flow.

Additionally, publication tabs were incorporated to organize content more effectively. 
These tabs provide clear navigation points that separate different types of information, making it easier for users to discover, browse, and understand each section without feeling overwhelmed.


## Profile 

|       Before        |       After             |  
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| ![perfil-conf(before)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f62a1dfa-1eea-4c62-bda8-ea649c13477f) | ![perfil-conf(after)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0920e1c8-ec37-406c-925d-edd14ad6b50b) |

To address accessibility limitations and weak visual contrast in the profile and settings interfaces, several key improvements were applied.
A dedicated settings frame was introduced to centralize account and preference management. This structure helps users locate options more quickly and reduces the effort required to navigate between different configuration areas.

The Edit Profile interface was also redesigned, incorporating a stronger visual hierarchy, clearer spacing, and more readable elements. 
These changes ensure that users can easily identify editable fields, understand available actions, and make updates with greater confidence.

Then, both accessibility and user control have been significantly enhanced, providing a more inclusive experience and enabling users to manage their profiles and settings more efficiently.


## Book Publishing

|       Before        |       After             |  
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| ![publicar(before)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11b398f8-6117-4b8d-802d-7eafa97782ff) | ![publicar(after)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66578e4d-d164-46a8-8dc0-c56347ea3d29) |

To improve the clarity and reliability of the book publication process, the interface was redesigned to reduce user errors and provide more structured guidance throughout the workflow.

The input process was streamlined by simplifying the required fields, making the initial data entry less overwhelming and easier to complete. This reduces cognitive load and minimizes the likelihood of incomplete or incorrect submissions.
A new AI-powered photo detection feature was incorporated, allowing users to upload a cover image or an ISBN photo. The system automatically extracts and fills in the book information, significantly speeding up the process and reducing manual input.

To ensure accuracy, a dedicated Data Validation interface was added. Here, users can review the auto-detected details, correct any errors, and confirm the information before publishing. 
This step not only prevents inaccurate entries but also supports more consistent data across the platform—especially important for book donation or exchange workflows.

## Chats

|       Before        |       After             |  
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| ![chats(before)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f235ab5-8dc4-412a-8d27-9d3f2037330f) | ![chat(after)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0de33b5-ade3-445a-8656-a91f00aef18a) |

To improve communication clarity and ensure users receive proper feedback during interactions, several enhancements were applied to both the chat list and the in-chat interface.

Message timestamps and read receipts were introduced, using a simple visual code: a green checkmark indicates that a message has been read, while a gray checkmark represents an unread message. 
This addition provides users with immediate confirmation of message status, reducing uncertainty and improving the sense of responsiveness.

An Exchange Section Tab was added to centralize all ongoing exchanges, allowing users to quickly access conversations related specifically to book trades or donations. 
This organizational structure helps streamline navigation and keeps related interactions grouped together.
The chat list itself was reorganized to group conversations by exchange, making it easier for users to locate the correct chat without confusion—especially when managing multiple interactions simultaneously.

## Ranking

|       Before        |       After             |  
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| ![ranking(before)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c110910e-950c-418e-9d35-ef5bb2af51f5) ![ranking(before)_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f69839a-86ed-4d2d-b48a-e1c78c760add) | ![ranking(after)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba99739a-1857-41c3-9e60-b89c583186c3) |

To improve clarity and reduce unnecessary visual noise in the ranking interface, the likes/dislikes system was removed, eliminating subjective or unclear rating signals. 
In its place, a points-based ranking was implemented, using objective metrics such as books published, successful exchanges or donations, and user evaluations.

The ranking interface becomes more visually consistent, easier to interpret, and more motivating for users, while maintaining a clean and accessible design.

## Search

|       Before        |       After             |  
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| ![busqueda(before)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86feacb4-417b-4510-9060-7e3bb7a9e5b4) | ![busqueda(after)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3a9feb2-aa36-4435-9dbc-3f5570dd5cce) |

To address confusion caused by unclear icons and labels in the search interface, an advanced filter system was introduced. 
This system uses clear, well-labeled checkboxes for condition, language, and genre, allowing users to refine their searches with greater precision and confidence.

Additionally, a Recent Searches section was added to provide quick access to previously used queries, helping users repeat or adjust past searches without re-entering all the information.

### 7.5. Accessibility topics

Visual contrast and readability: Adjustments were made to the contrast of the navigation bar, buttons, and typography, following the heuristic recommendations (with “Low accessibility and visual contrast” identified as a critical issue). 
The proposed solutions include improved color choices, larger text sizes, and proper spacing between elements to support users with different accessibility needs.

Larger and well-spaced buttons: To ensure better touch interaction, the issue of “Buttons placed too closely together” was addressed. 
The updated interfaces now provide clear layouts with sufficiently large touch areas, aligning with heuristic accessibility guidelines.

These improvements aim to make the experience usable and accessible for the majority of users, including those with visual or motor difficulties, and directly reflect the response to the heuristic evaluation as well as basic web and mobile accessibility standards.
